======================

The paper proposes to combine false positive reduction
(FPR), malignancy suspiciousness estimation (MSR), and
attribute prediction into one multi-branch 3D CNN and
achieved the state-of-the-art for FPR and MSR. My questions
are as follows:

1. The proposed multi-branch CNN needs to pre-train 3 CNNs
separately and combine and finetune them in the end. It is
seemingly memory- and time-consuming. Is it possible to use
one CNN to learn the 3 tasks jointly?

2. The authors selected 3 attributes out of 8 to learn. Why
not predict all 8 attributes? How about using cross-entropy
instead of Eq. 1 as the selection criterion?

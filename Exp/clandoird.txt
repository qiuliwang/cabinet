CLANdroid downloads the APKs directly from Google Play
and then decompiles the APKs to extract source code identifiers,
sensors, API calls, and intents, and Android permissions
with the infrastructure depicted in Fig. 2. The general process
is as the following: 
(i) the APK files are unziped by using the
apktool1 tool, which reveals the compiled Android app code
file (note that an APK is just a set of zipped DEX files); then

apktool d test.apk
apktool b test


(ii) the DEX files are translated to JAR files using the dex2jar2
tool; then 

d2j-dex2jar.bat classes.dex

(iii) CLANdroid extracts the .class files from the
JAR files by using the 7zip3 tool; and finally 

(iv) CLANdroid decompiles the .class files to .java files by using the
JAD4 decompiler tool (Fig. 2). Once each APK is decompiled
into JAR files and source code, CLANdroid extracts semantic
anchors from different artifacts: identifiers and intents from
source code, APIs and sensors from JAR files, and permissions
from the AndroidManifest.xml files.

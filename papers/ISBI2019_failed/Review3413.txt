======================

This paper proposed a 3D-CNN based method for fine grain
lung nodule diagnosis on CT scans. The major contributions
are: (1) two tasks, false positive reduction and malignancy
suspiciousness estimation, were merged into a unified long
nodule diagnosis system, (2) a novel attribute sensitive
multi-branch 3D CNN is proposed. The method was evaluated
on the LIDC-IDRL and LUNA2016 data set. The performance is
comparable to the state-of-the-art methods.

My comments are:
(1) The five branches are trained separately, which does
not share the features efficiently.
(2) The selected attributes are like hand-crafted features,
which does not take advantage of CNN features for
classification.
(3) The proposed method's performance is comparable to the
PN-SAMP-M. What is the difference between these two
methods? What is the benefits of the proposed method?

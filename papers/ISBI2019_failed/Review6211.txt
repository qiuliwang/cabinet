Reviewer 6 of ISBI 2019 submission 342

Comments to the author
======================

Authors suggested combining of false positive reduction and
malignancy suspicious estimation into one task to be
addressed by deep learning.
In 'Method', authors explained that MSE, which performs a
further classification on the positive samples, is the
successive part of FPR. In figure 1; however, FPR is the
successive part of MSE.
There is no explanation of deep learning architecture in
figure 1 including learning and hyper parameters and the
reason of using these kernel sizes.
LIDC dataset contains labels with no agreement among
annotators, authors should address how they used those
labels for their learning.
There are some typos in the paper, such as, "in the
training 'phrase'" which should be corrected to 'phase' and
so on.
